# A project description
For the Q2 Project, it brings me great joy to propose an idea that will provide a quick and painless service to remedy the adverse effects of dehydration to those in need. Phlebor, a mobile friendly and web application, allows users to request an intravenous therapy service delivered right to their location, no matter how absurd. 


# Who uses it?
Our target market consists of those who become theroughly dehydrated, typically after strenuous workouts or binge drinking, desire near-immediate treatment, and refuse to spend on the high fees of a hospitol or ambulence.


# What outputs do they need?
Time of delivery
Real time animation of the IV vehicle's location.

# What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
User's location.

# A list of technologies that you plan to use
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
